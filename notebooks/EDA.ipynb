Clinique requires its high-risk suppliers to undergo an audit conducted by an independent, third-party auditor at least every two years. Currently, the auditors utilise the Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA) Best Practice Guidelines and audit report format. If a supplier appears to be in non-compliance with the Supplier Code of Conduct, Clinique expects the supplier to co-operate and provide such additional information to Clinique as may be required by Clinique in order for it to make a determination whether the supplier is in compliance. If Clinique determines that the supplier is not in compliance, then the remedies may include, among other things, termination of business with Clinique or the development and implementation of a corrective action plan that would need to be implemented within a certain fixed time period. Clinique may follow such implementation with an audit, as it deems appropriate.\n",

      "Cisco Statement on the Prevention of Slavery and Human Trafficking\n",
      "At Cisco, labor and human rights are a top priority for us. We are committed to treating everyone who works at or with Cisco with dignity and respect, and explicitly prohibit human trafficking and the use of involuntary labor within our supply base.\n",
      "We are committed to working with industry partners to drive common high standards. We also encourage our employees to lead beyond Cisco - by partnering with other thought leaders across the electronics industry, we increase our positive impact.\n",
      "The below statement communicates Cisco's policies and practices to respect human rights, and how we identify and address potential impacts, mitigate risks and maximize opportunities for human rights to flourish. Cisco upholds and respects human rights as contained in the United Nations (UN) Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the eight Core Labor Conventions developed by the International Labor Organization (ILO), the UN Global Compact (UNGC), and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP). Cisco’s approach is informed by the documents identified above, anchored to the approach set forth in the UNGP, and extends through ongoing engagement of stakeholders.\n",
      "About Our Supply Chain Network\n",
      "Our sourcing and manufacturing are entirely outsourced to a global network of specialist suppliers and partners. Hundreds of suppliers around the world supply the parts that go into our products, and then manufacturing partners assemble and test finished products, provide logistical services, and collect, refurbish, and recycle products at the end of their useful life. The major elements of our supply chain are briefly described below.\n",
      "Component suppliers: a much wider group of suppliers, often contracted directly by Cisco to provide parts to our manufacturing partners according to our specifications;\n",
      "Manufacturing partners: a select group of suppliers that produce finished Cisco products; and\n",
      "Logistics service providers that transport components and finished products.\n",
      "Cisco's Policies and Actions\n",
      "Cisco's policies and approach to preventing involuntary labor and human trafficking have been developed based on international labor and human rights standards as well as best practices across the global business community. These policies establish the baseline expectations as well as communicate our values and help promote trust and collaboration as a key underpinning of our many business and stakeholder relationships. Cisco’s specific policies include:\n",
      "Global Human Rights Policy: Our approach and commitment to upholding and respecting human rights is governed by our Global Human Rights Policy. Our policy is informed by international human rights frameworks, including the UDHR, the ILO core labor standards, and the UNGC. We review our policy on a regular basis, and we use a company-wide human rights governance structure to implement our commitment. Our Human Rights Working Group includes experts from functions across the business.\n",
      "Code of Business Conduct (COBC): Our COBC is a crucial part of our company culture that provides employees with a clear understanding of our core values and the high standards for ethical conduct by which we conduct our business.\n",
      "Supplier Code of Conduct with Freely Chosen Employment Requirement: Cisco's Supplier Code of Conduct (the \"Code”)is aligned with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) (formerly Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition) Code of Conduct. It defines the expectations Cisco has of its suppliers to implement management systems to ensure workers’ rights are protected, including our requirements regarding workers having the right to freely choose their employment, and prohibits the use of forced, bonded (including debt bondage) and indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery, or trafficking of persons. Furthermore, it is a foundational element of our Supplier Ethics Policy.\n",
      "Supplier Ethics Policy: Our Supplier Ethics Policy requires Cisco suppliers and their employees to conduct themselves with the highest standards of honesty, fairness, and personal integrity. As part of the supplier qualification process, suppliers must acknowledge that subcontractors and any other parties they engage to provide services to Cisco, will act in accordance with the Supplier Ethics Policy. Furthermore, suppliers acknowledge and commit to the Code when they agree to the Supplier Ethics Policy.\n",
      "Cisco has taken multiple actions to ensure the prevention of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in our own\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "business and supply chain, including;\n",
      "Verification: We evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery through conformance to the Code. We pursue conformance by using the RBA's Maplecroft Risk Assessment tool, Supplier Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ), Validated Audit Process (VAP), or equivalent. We also convene or attend teleconferences, webinars and other meetings so that we may better understand and monitor risks associated with labor recruitment practices. We conduct these activities regularly and extensively. Audits: We conduct supplier audits or review audit reports through the RBA’s audit sharing system, and conduct unannounced audits as necessary. The tools referenced above are utilized as part of a risk-based approach to determining which suppliers to audit. The audit process includes self-assessments, on-site inspections, document reviews, and worker and management interviews. Certification: The Code states that companies should have a management system that contains a process to communicate requirements and to monitor compliance. Moreover, we have master purchasing agreements, purchase order or equivalent terms and conditions in place requiring compliance with international standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, we require suppliers to adopt and abide by the Code. Accountability: Non-compliance with human rights related provisions of the Code is taken very seriously. Corrective action plans are expected to be implemented in the shortest possible timeline with accountability clearly defined and tracked. The senior executive in charge of the supplier relationship is responsible for ensuring compliance with the Code and remediation of concerns. Progress is reported to supply chain executive leadership, at minimum on a quarterly basis, and more frequently as needed. Furthermore, for our own employees, we require compliance with our COBC, and employees certify compliance annually. Our COBC describes how to raise concerns, which are tracked at both regional and corporate levels. Training: Our strategy focuses on engaging and capacity-building. We regularly engage across the globe to train on Code fundamentals. This helps us build capacity and focus on improvement. For our own employees, our COBC training helps guide our employees to make ethical, professional and respectful choices. Further, we have developed and launched customized training including specific details about human rights in supply chain. For suppliers, the investments we collectively make to RBA workshops and training content are mutually beneficial, ensuring understanding of policies and standards. RBA’s Learning Academy provides online trainings on a range of topics, including methods to combat trafficked and forced labor in the supply chain. As part of our audit process, suppliers will be directed to training resources related to an audit finding and are expected to complete the training.\n",
      "Commitment to Leadership Through Collaboration and Transparency\n",
      "We are actively involved in advancing industry-wide responsible practices through our engagement in the RBA, a nonprofit alliance of leading companies dedicated to respecting the rights and promoting well-being of workers and communities engaged in the global electronics supply chain. Cisco is a founding member of the RBA, and contributes to the development and periodic revision of the RBA Code of Conduct.\n",
      "We are committed to transparently communicating our actions. For further information on steps undertaken during the year, refer to the latest version of Cisco's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report.\n",

      "Seasalt is a clothing and lifestyle brand and multi-channel retailer based in Cornwall in the UK. Seasalt has 29 own brand stores, nearly 400 wholesale customers across the UK and Europe as well as an established online presence.\n",
      "The business’ head office is based in Falmouth, Cornwall and comprises creative teams who design and develop the products, buying and merchandising, marketing and communications, finance, customer services, property, organisational and development teams , as well as a central distribution centre which is located in Redruth, Cornwall. Seasalt manufactures and imports its products from its supply chains that are located in the following countries: India, Sri Lanka, China, Vietnam, Portugal, Turkey, Tunisia, UK, Bulgaria, Spain, and the Czech Republic.\n",
      "Seasalt values its supply chain and understand we are only as good as the partners we have producing our products. Seasalt is committed to working in partnership with its supply chain and to resolving issues found within it together.\n",
      "Our policies on slavery and human trafficking\n",
      "To gain a view of the Seasalt supply chain, Seasalt requires all of its suppliers as part of their contract with us to agree to our ethical standards. This policy embraces the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) Base Code and covers areas such as the denial of freedom of association and forced labour, and clearly defines that forced labour and freedom of association are unacceptable to Seasalt.\n",
      "Due diligence\n",
      "To ensure compliance with our ethical standards we ask, in addition to a signed contract and ethical standards commitment statement, that all of our suppliers join Sedex, the Supplier Ethical Data Exchange. Sedex is a not for profit membership organisation dedicated to driving improvements in responsible and ethical business practices in global supply chains. Our suppliers are also required to complete self-assessment ethical workbooks on a regular basis and to share copies of any external independent audits and their own policies and procedures in regards to freedom of association and forced labour. Sedex work with many brands and high street retailers, so are able to support and collate and advise us and our suppliers on all of the information they receive to provide a global view on the ethical challenges faced in global manufacture.\n",
      "Our Compliance and Ethics Manager works closely with Sedex to ensure that all of our supply partners are up to date with completion of self-assessments.\n",
      "(continued)\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "Our process for this is as follows:\n",
      "1. Self-Assessment: We collect information within the Sedex Self-Assessment Questionnaire that could be indicators of managements systems gaps or forced or bonded labour (such as holding of identity \t\t documents, wage deductions made, etc). New questions have been added to name labor providers used by suppliers. These issues can then be addressed further, often via a third party audit.\n",
      "2. Risk Assessment: Sedex works with global risks analytics experts, Maplecroft, who reference hundreds of indices - from human rights violations to political risk factors to flag country and industry risk factors. This is combined with answers from the Sedex Self-Assessment Questionnaire which highlights management systems risk indicators for human trafficking and forced or bonded labor.\n",
      "3. Audit: Sedex has created SMETA (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit) – a free, publicly available 4 pillar audit methodology in ethical trade auditing, benefitting companies and their suppliers. Sedex’s SMETA audit system is typical and very widely used.\n",
      "4. Reporting tools: The Sedex platform enables members to report on trends across the supply chain and look for possible self-assessment or audit non-compliance indicators of forced or bonded labor that might seem innocuous on their own.\n",
      "The self-assessment results and any other findings feed directly into the Seasalt supplier strategy. This forms the framework for the business strategy each season and is key to ensuring we make the best product in the most responsible way possible.\n",
      "In addition to the contractual requirements and Sedex, Seasalt team members regularly visit our suppliers to review and audit their factories, working conditions and employees directly. Seasalt team members are provided with appropriate training internally to ensure they are able to address issues when with the suppliers.\n",
      "Seasalt recognises that the issue of human trafficking is a global issue and often difficult to detect. To ensure that we have the most honest and clear view of our supply chain we acknowledge that our relationships, commitment and open communication with our supply chain are critical to ensure that should any issues be found they are resolved jointly to eliminate risk to all parties involved in the manufacture of Seasalt product.\n",

      "MODERN SLAVERY ACT 2019 STATEMENT\n",
      "The Modern Slavery Act 2015 requires a commercial organisation over a certain size to publish a slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year. Chesnara plc welcomes the act and with its subsidiaries (together “Chesnara”) is committed to the eradication of human trafficking and slavery. Slavery and human trafficking are abuses of a person’s freedom and rights. We are totally opposed to such abuses in our direct operations, our indirect operations and our supply chain as a whole.\n",
      "THE MEANING OF SLAVERY AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING\n",
      "Our understanding of slavery and human trafficking is based on the definitions set out in the Modern Slavery Act 2015. We recognise that forced labour as a form of slavery includes debt bondage and the restriction of a person’s freedom of movement whether that be physical, non-physical or, for example, by the withholding of a worker’s identity papers.\n",
      "OUR BUSINESS AND SUPPLY CHAINS\n",

      "The operating model of our UK business is directed towards maintaining shareholder value by outsourcing all support activities to professional specialists. The activities typically include policy administration, systems management, accounting, actuarial and investment management. This has been provided by long-term contracts held with only three suppliers. As these are significant, the responsibility of oversight has remained with the central governance team.\n",
      "\n",
      "We consider that the greatest risk of slavery and human trafficking would be in our supply chain where operational and managerial oversight is out of our direct control but we require our partners to operate in line with our corporate values.\n",

      "RELEVANT POLICIES\n",
      "Chesnara has clear, Board-approved Modern Slavery, Whistleblowing, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Fraud Policies, and actively encourages the reporting and exposure of any unethical behaviour. Any matter raised either via the whistleblowing or through the auditing processes are diligently investigated and appropriate action will be taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "RISK ASSESSMENT AND DUE DILIGENCE\n",
      "We believe the risk of slavery and human trafficking within our own organisation is substantially avoided and mitigated as a result of strict policies and procedures. It is reinforced through the oversight built into our business operations and the knowledge and skills of our staff. We expect the same responsibility from our suppliers, and where we currently do not have assurance, we will be seeking to have confirmation from each supplier. Our procurement process with any future supplier will incorporate the requirement for our supplier to provide their assistance and assurance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015. This will enable us to have greater knowledge of our business partners.\n",

It sets out the steps taken by the British United Provident Association Limited and other relevant group companies1 (“Bupa”) during the year ending 31 December 2018 to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its business and supply chain.\n",
      "1 This statement sets out the steps taken by the British United Provident Association Limited and the companies listed in Annex 1 all of which fall within the scope of section 54(2) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and the Modern Slavery Act 2015 Transparency in Supply Chains) Regulation 2015.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Slavery and trafficking is more than a just a crime: it is a crime against people and is responsible for untold misery and suffering.\n",
      "Bupa therefore continues to be strongly committed to combating the real and growing problem of modern slavery and trafficking.\n",
      "We recognise it can affect any sector or industry and we take seriously our responsibility to be alert to the risks in our business and in our wider supply chain.\n",
      "We expect our people and our suppliers to share our commitment to help ensure modern slavery and trafficking do not exist in our business or supply chains.\n",
      "Bupa has published two previous modern slavery statements for the years 2016 and 2017. This statement provides an update on what steps we have taken in 2018 to try to ensure that there is no modern slavery or trafficking in our organisation or supply chains.\n",
      "Although the scope of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 is limited to companies carrying on business in the UK with a turnover of at least £36m, as a global organisation, we recognise slavery and trafficking is a global problem. This statement therefore applies to all of our wholly owned or controlled companies within our world-wide group of companies2.\n",
      "This statement has been approved by our Board.\n",
      "Key areas of focus in 2018\n",

      "Residential aged care accounts for 9% of our business with 23,000 residents in the UK, Spain, Australia and New Zealand.\n",
      "We directly employ over 80,000 people, principally in the UK, Australia, Spain, Poland, Chile, New Zealand, Hong Kong, the USA, Brazil, the Middle East and Ireland. Many more work for our associate businesses in Saudi Arabia and India.\n",

      "As a Group, our supply chains are local and global, with a total annual spend in excess of £1.5bn on bought in goods and services with more than 20,000 suppliers around the world.\n",
      "Our approach to tackling the risk of modern slavery and human trafficking\n",
      "Ultimate oversight responsibility for the steps Bupa is taking and its approach to tackling modern slavery as well as the publishing of this statement sits with our Board. Our progress and the preparation of this statement is monitored by our Executive Risk Committee. The work and direction of our organisation with respect to modern slavery is led by our Legal team, with support from our Corporate and Social Responsibility team and our Procurement and People teams in each market unit.\n",
      "We recognise the challenges all large organisations face in effectively uncovering and dealing with modern slavery risks within a complex and multitiered supply chain.\n",
      "We want to make sure our approach focuses on those areas we consider likely to make the biggest difference.\n",
      "Combating modern slavery and human trafficking is a challenge all organisations face, and we want to make sure we’re sharing ideas and experiences with others to learn and develop best practice in this area. We know that collaborating with others is essential given the deep rooted and system nature of modern slavery and human trafficking.\n",

      "Our policies and contractual controls\n",
      "Our Enterprise Policy suite defines the overarching principles for how Bupa does business in key areas of risk. It also helps to ensure that we meet business objectives and comply with legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Enterprise Policies are approved by appropriate Executive and Board committees to ensure they appropriately define the minimum expectations around how we do business. The Enterprise Policies apply to all Bupa businesses including wholly owned subsidiaries and all businesses are expected to comply with the\n",
      "3 Modern Slavery Statement 2018\n",
      "\n",
      "principles and requirements of all applicable policies.\n",
      "As reported in our previous statement, Bupa has a number of policies and codes that are relevant to tackling modern slavery and trafficking with respect to its business and suppliers:\n",
      "• Our People Policy sets out our aim to cultivate a workplace environment that is fair, open and respectful, and one that promotes and protects the rights and dignity of all employees. We enact employment practices, contracts of employment and collective agreements that are lawful and aligned to the Bupa Code and values.\n",
      "• All our people are bound by the Bupa Code which requires that we treat everyone with respect and dignity and that we make sure we do business responsibly. It makes it clear that we follow the laws, regulations, policies and standards that affect us, wherever we are in the world, and that we speak up about things that aren’t right. In 2018 we enhanced our digital training to make the Code more relevant to our specific business lines, insurance, Hospitals/Clinics, Dental and Care Services – to help our people better understand their roles.\n",
      "• Our Speak Up policy sets out our commitment to being a place where people are free to question things and raise anything they are concerned about. We encourage people to speak up about things relating to Bupa that aren’t, or don’t seem right (including breach of Bupa policies) by raising them with their manager or using our confidential Speak Up channel. There is a locally tailored approach for each Market Unit, and the group policy specifically calls out modern slavery and human trafficking as examples of things we encourage people to speak up about.\n",
      "• Our Suppliers Policy sets out our Board’s expectation that Bupa has effective processes for the selection, contracting and management with our direct suppliers, allowing us to manage the risks posed by these suppliers throughout the supplier relationship lifecycle. Our Human Rights Statement outlines our commitment to protect, preserve and promote the human rights of our customers, our people and our partners around the world. It is guided by fundamental principles of human rights, such as those in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n",
      "• Our Anti-slavery Policy for third party suppliers in our UK market unit sets out the actions and behaviours we expect of suppliers in being aware of, addressing, and being open with us about, instances of modern slavery and human trafficking within their own business and supply chains. Our Standard Terms and Conditions of Purchase require suppliers in our UK market unit (and in turn their own supply chains) to comply with our Anti-slavery policy and to notify\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "us immediately of any actual or suspected breach of it, or the Modern Slavery Act, so that we are able to determine an appropriate course of action. • Our Sustainable Supply Chain Statement makes clear our expectation that suppliers, subcontractors and their respective supply chains will comply with all domestic legislation, all applicable International Labour Organisation conventions and protocols, the United Nations Global Compact and the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This commitment includes, but is not limited to, compliance with the Modern Slavery Act, not using child or forced labour and compliance with the rights and entitlements of indigenous peoples.\n",
      "Our due diligence processes in relation to modern slavery and human trafficking risks in our business and supply chains\n",
      "Within Bupa\n",
      "Since 2016, with the help of our People teams around the world, we carry out an annual assessment of any risk of modern slavery and human trafficking occurring within Bupa itself. The questions are based on Home Office guidance4 and ask targeted questions about each Market Unit’s practices relating to recruitment, use of agency and temporary workers, on-boarding of new employees and terms and conditions.\n",
      "These responses are then evaluated by our global People team. For 2018, our assessment did not identify any areas of concern.\n",
      "Within our supply chain\n",
      "We recognise there are many challenges that we, in common with other large organisations, face in full transparency across each tier of our supply chain. At present, we’re only able to carry out meaningful due diligence on those who supply goods and services directly to Bupa. In 2018, we improved our procurement due diligence processes in our businesses in the UK geography by:\n",
      "1. Continuing with our existing modern slavery due diligence risk assessment that identifies high risk suppliers that serve the UK geography. This process occurs annually. (See below).\n",
      "2. Extending the current standard UK due diligence process to now include a modern slavery assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "If through any of these methods an adverse response is identified, the case is investigated further, and a plan of action is established.\n",
      "We’ve also updated our General Purchasing Conditions to include specific modern slavery clauses in our second largest market – Europe and Latin America. In Australia we’ve introduced a supplier code of conduct that sets out the minimum standards of behaviour Bupa expects its suppliers to meet in the areas of labour and human rights, health and safety, sustainability, business integrity, privacy and supplier diversity.\n",
      "Identifying the risk of modern slavery across our business\n",
      "We segment our direct suppliers based on value and risk and carry out due diligence accordingly. For modern slavery risks specifically, we identified potential high-risk suppliers across all our market units, based on the country in which the supplier is based (in the case of goods) and where the supply is delivered (in the case of services), as well as the sectors in which they operate. Our assessment of risk in each country is based on the risk categorisation set out in the Global Slavery Index, which is published by the Walk Free Foundation. We have designated countries into high, medium and low risk based on the underlying data that inputs into the Index. There is no publicly recognised index for sector risk. We have therefore compiled our own list with input from external advisors having regard to factors such as the likelihood that workers receive low pay or are required to do jobs most people would seek to avoid. If a supplier is based in, or delivers services in, a high-risk country, and within a sector we determine to be medium or high risk, then we consider them to be at high risk for modern slavery and human trafficking and they are subject to the enhanced due diligence described below.\n",
      "In 2018, we continued to remove the minimum spend threshold we’d previously applied to this matrix, recognising that this bears no relationship to the risk itself. This has led to enhanced, targeted due diligence being carried out on an increased number of suppliers during 2017 and 2018.\n",
      "Suppliers considered to be high risk for modern slavery and human trafficking were subject to enhanced due diligence to help us understand more about their internal controls and engagement with their own supply chains. This due diligence is in the form of a detailed questionnaire, evaluated by our Procurement team, in consultation with our Legal, Risk and Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability teams. The questions focus on whether these highrisk suppliers have whistle-blowing policies in place, whether they required similar policies of their own suppliers, and whether any concerns that could be\n",

      "\n",
      "In 2018, we continued to focus on increasing our understanding of the existing whistleblowing measures our high-risk tier one suppliers have in place. We have done this by including specific questions around this in the enhanced due diligence we carry out on these suppliers. Responses are reviewed on an ongoing basis.\n",
      "We have now completed three years of training focussed on building awareness with our Senior Management, Procurement and People teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of investigations undertaken into reports of modern slavery and remedial actions taken in response\n",

      "In 2018 we did not receive any reports of modern slavery within our business or our tier one suppliers. We have therefore not carried out any investigations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Modern slavery training\n",
      "We’ve completed three years’ worth of training which in the first two years focused on building awareness within our Senior Management, Procurement and People teams, and Speak Up whistle-blowing line officers around the world of what human trafficking and modern slavery is and the various responsibilities these teams have for monitoring compliance with our policies and reporting concerns.\n",
      "In 2018, building on the existing training in place, modern slavery was discussed at the annual Global Procurement Forum, and with Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability leads.\n",
      "Our priorities for the year ahead\n",
      "In the year ahead, we intend to:\n",
      "• Establish a working group, comprised of Legal, People, Procurement, Risk and Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability representatives. Now that the act has been in operation for three years, the group will review our learnings and approach\n",
      "• Refine and develop our understanding and approach for addressing modern slavery,\n",
      "\n",
      "5 Modern Slavery Statement 2018\n",
      "\n",
      "taking on board the lessons learned and feedback we’ve invited from other organisations, NGOs, and experts in this field. We want to identify further areas for collaboration with other organisations on areas of common concern, so we can take collective action against human trafficking and modern slavery. We want to seek out examples of best practice that can be applied by Bupa in tackling modern slavery and trafficking. • Refresh staff training for specific audiences including Senior Management, Procurement and People teams, building learnings from the past three years. • Take preparatory steps for the introduction of anti-modern slavery reporting in Australia. • Review our risk assessment process, developing a more sophisticated approach which takes account of the extent to which Bupa can influence and drive change in a given area of exposure; enabling us to prioritise those areas where we can have the most significant future impact.\n",
      "We understand that modern slavery risk is not static, and will continue to evolve our approach, including updating our KPI’s.\n",

    " - doc id 645: \"...Seasalt team members regularly visit our suppliers to review and audit their factories, working conditions and employees directly. Seasalt team members are provided with appropriate training internally to ensure they are able to address issues when with the suppliers...\"\n",
    " - doc id 307: \"...Adobe encourages suppliers to utilize EICC's Learning Academy which contains online learning modules that cover the EICC Code of Conduct...\" and earlier in the document: \"...Adobe commits publicly to the EICC Code of Conduct (Code)...We evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery through conformance to the Code, Section A.1, which states, among other standards, that: Forced, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary prison labor, slavery or trafficking of persons shall not be used...\"\n",
    " - doc id 510: \"...TRAINING AND RESPONSIBILITY The Board and Senior Management have responsibility for implementing this policy statement and ensuring that any employee, in particular those who have direct responsibility for the supply chain, has adequate resources to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place within the organisation and within its supply chain...\"\n",
    " - doc id 626: \"...We’ve completed three years’ worth of training which in the first two years focused on building awareness within our Senior Management, Procurement and People teams, and Speak Up whistle-blowing line officers around the world of what human trafficking and modern slavery is and the various responsibilities these teams have for monitoring compliance with our policies and reporting concerns....\"\n",
    " - doc id 420: \"...We have been taking pro-active steps with respect to our procurement processes and our supply chains to ensure that suppliers self-certify that they do not endorse, enable or facilitate human trafficking or slavery within their business and work is on-going to build the self-certification requirement into our procurement process. Ethical procurement training has been completed by procurement staff in the UK....\"\n",

However there appears to be an incomplete sentence following this one, \"In addition, Destinology is included within Saga's wider audit and compliance activity to ensure we comply with both the law and\" which may indicate there was some text lost that could have described the training in more detail. It is possibly misclassified?\n",
    "- doc id 59 contains only one mention of training: \"...The business has provided training to key managers in social compliance requirements...\" but this is not clear whether the training is anti-slavery related (social compliance requirements are not defined elsewhere in the document), though it likely is. This is debatable whether it should be assigned class 1 or 0.\n",
    "- doc id 243 does not mention training. It may be this portion that could be interpreted as implying training: \"...all Lenovo employees are required to certify awareness and compliance with our Employee Code of Conduct...As part of its Employee Code, Lenovo explicitly prohibits the use of child labor and forced labor...\" though that does not seem sufficient to indicate training. It also appears that there is a portion of this document missing as the last sentence ends abruptly: \"...Supplier accountability of the program is achieved through a formal management system which includes standardized monthly reporting to senior procurement management based on specific key performance indicators. Specifically we measure:\" It may be that the relevant portion of the document was contained in this missing portion.\n",

It is likely that it is too noisy in its current state with only 650 labeled documents to be able to train a reliable machine learning classifier. Either the data quality needs to be addressed or many more labeled documents are likely needed."

      "The group consists of over 7 hotels and resorts in Northern Ireland. The business relies on the services of around 1,000 workers.\n",
      "Hastings Hotels recognises that Modern Slavery is not an issue confined to the overseas hospitality sector. In particular we recognise the risks that arise from the use of foreign and migrant labour, and from supply chains both in the UK and overseas.\n",
      "POLICIES AND PROCEDURES\n",
      "In the financial year, the existing policies and procedures of Hastings Hotels which would assist in combatting Modern Slavery included: checks and verification in respect of migrant workers; a whistleblowing policy that encouraged reports from staff of unethical conduct; and a central register of recruitment agents and supplier contracts.\n",
      "· A Modern Slavery Policy has been put in place. In the coming months, Hastings Hotels intends to take additional steps including:\n",

      "Modern slavery is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights. It can take various forms, such as slavery, servitude, forced and compulsory labour and human trafficking, all of which have in common the deprivation of a person's liberty by another in order to exploit them for personal or commercial gain. Highclere International Investors LLP, Highclere Investment Management Limited and Highclere Inc. (for purposes of this statement only, “Highclere”) is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in its business dealings and commercial relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to help to ensure that modern slavery is not taking place within its business or supply chains.\n",
      "Highclere’s services are provided from offices in London and Connecticut. Highclere’s directors, officers, employees and legal members (as appropriate) are subject to a Code of Ethics which sets out high ethical standards for business conduct. Annual training is provided on the importance of ethical conduct.\n",
      "Highclere’s primary suppliers include custodians, fund administrators, IT service providers and professional services firms (these typically provide legal, tax, accounting and professional services). Highclere has considered its risk profile and that of its primary suppliers. In the case of certain smaller suppliers, where Highclere has determined that the risks of exploitation may be higher, Highclere has utilised contract wording (for example on right to work status and minimum pay levels in excess of living wage figures) to help ensure compliance.\n",
      "This statement is made pursuant to Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes Highclere’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the current financial year.\n",

    "- The data is quite inconsistent in punctuation formatting, especially with respect to line breaks. These may need to be cleaned up depending on the algorithmic approach.\n",
    "- Given the number of mislabeled documents and the small quantity of labeled documents in the first place, it is unlikely we can train a good-performance machine learning classifier with the data as is. Perhaps an approach should be developed that could ignore the labels and generate its own class predictions more accurately based on a pre-trained model (Zero- or few-shot learning). One possibility is an extractive question answering model (e.g. a SQuAD2.0-trained model)."
